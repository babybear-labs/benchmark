# ZK Benchmark

## Overview

This repository hosts the source code and resources for benchmarking various Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proofs. It builds upon the original repositories of Halo2, RISC0, Nexus, SP1, Jolt, Circom, and Powdr with our implementations of proofs including but not limited to SHA256, Fibonacci, and Poseidon operations.

Our aim is to benchmark the performance of these proofs, comparing them in terms of time, space, and other metrics. This comprehensive comparison will not only highlight the most popular ZK proofs and their implementations but also deepen our understanding of their inner workings, developer friendliness, and proving systems.

## Goals

- **Benchmark Operations:**
  - **Fibonacci:** Variants 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000
  - **SHA256:** Variants 32b, 1k, 10k Bytes
  - **Poseidon:** Variants 32b, 100b

- **Additional Benchmarks:**
  - Arithmetic Operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
  - Loop: Variants 10, 100, 1000
  - Hash Functions: Pederson, RPO, Keccak (Variants 1k, 10k Bytes)
  - Merkle Tree: Generation, Membership/Inclusion, Merge
  - nth Prime: Variants 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000
  - Cryptographic Verifications: ECDSA, Elliptic Curve, BLS Verification, BLS Aggregation

The key differences between these proof systems include their setup complexity, proof features, post-quantum resistance, scalability, and parallel execution capabilities. Some use recursive proofs, while others focus on efficiency or general-purpose functionality. The systems also vary in their post-quantum resistance and ability to scale and parallelize.
